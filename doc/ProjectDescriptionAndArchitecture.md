The goal of the project is to develop a real-time strategy game using the Unity engine. The project should be developed in groups of 2-3 students. The game should follow a component-based architecture.

The development of the project will be split into four milestones:
- Project proposal + architecture: general description of the game design and architecture.
- Project prototype: first prototype including models, rendering and interactions.
- Project advanced prototype: prototype including animation and physics.
- Project final deliverable: prototype including some AI and pathfinding.

You are free to decide the art and most of the design aspects of the game. However, the minimum design requirement is that the game should be composed of the following components:
- Two "building" type of units.
- Two types of dynamic units. These can be vehicles, flying units, etc..
- One type of human-like unit. This can count as one of the two dynamic units. The purpose of this unit is to have a character that can be controlled with skeletal animation.
- Two types of enemy units.
- There should be at least one interaction between dynamic units and building units, one interaction between dynamic units and enemies, and one interaction between building units and enemies.
- Each unit should also have one general action it can perform, not related to interactions.
The game should also allow for meaningful play, implying that there is some logic behind the units and their interactions to achieve the game's goals.

Your project must include the following technical elements:
- Advanced 3D rendering as provided by the engine. These requirements are specified in more detail in the description of the "Project prototype".
- Animation and physics, as specified in the description of the "Project advanced prototype".
- AI, as specified in the description of the "Final submission".

You can include additional features of your interest if time permits. For example:
- Logic for the creation of new units
- A HUD and mini-map
- A map that is discoverable
- Music and sound effects
- Additional visual effects
- Multiple levels and game objectives
- A start-up screen, configuration screen
