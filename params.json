A trail particle effect will appear behind the unit as they move.\r\n\r\n### Spawning\r\nAllied microorganisms can be spawned by first selecting the [spawner](#spawners) then pressing 1 or the icon in the bottom right UI panel to spawn a red blood cell, or pressing 2 or the icon in the bottom right UI panel to spawn a white blood cell. A spawning animation particle effect will appear.\r\n\r\n### Mining resources\r\nTo mine resources to be transferred to the spawner, first select a [red blood cell](#red-blood-cell), then right click a [miner organ](#miners), and then right click a spawner organ. The red blood cell will continuously travel back and forth from the miner to the spawner, bringing resources.\r\n\r\n### Attacking Enemies\r\nTo Attack an enemy select a [white blood cell](#white-blood-cell), then right click on an enemy [pathogen](#pathogen) or [spore](#spore) or enemy Infection. When two units collide, the units use RigidBody physics to push the enemy units while dealing damage. A damage particle effect will sparkle around the enemy unit. When a unit dies it is removed from the game.\r\n\r\n## Identification\r\n### Microorganisms\r\n#### Red blood cell\r\n-   Red blood cell model\r\n-   Ally affiliation\r\n-   Collects resources from a miner and delivers to a spawner\r\n\r\n#### White blood cell\r\n-   White blood cell model\r\n-   Ally affiliation\r\n-   Attacks enemy units\r\n\r\n#### Spore\r\n-   Blue model identical to white blood cell model\r\n-   Enemy affiliation\r\n-   Builds [infections](#infection)\r\n\r\n#### Pathogen\r\n-   Skeletal animated model \r\n-   Enemy affiliation\r\n-   Attacks allied units\r\n\r\n### Miners\r\n#### Lungs\r\n-   Lungs model\r\n-   Ally affiliation\r\n-   Produces oxygen\r\n\r\n#### Stomach\r\n-   Stomach (actually liver) model\r\n-   Ally affiliation\r\n-   Produces protein\r\n\r\n#### Kidney\r\n-   Kidney model\r\n-   Ally affiliation\r\n-   Produces erythropoietin\r\n\r\n### Spawners\r\n#### Heart\r\n-   Heart model\r\n-   Ally affiliation\r\n-   Spawns red and white blood cells\r\n\r\n#### Infection\r\n-   Large dark purple bubbly model\r\n-   Enemy affiliation\r\n-   Spawns spores and pathogens\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n-   UI is incomplete, so the following functionality is all it contributes to:\r\n    -   The "Menu" button in the top left of the game window simply exits the game, as does the ESCAPE key (this is all ignored in the editor)\r\n    -   More UI elements are still to be added in the future\r\n-   Currently spawning animation plays on first launch\r\n-   A bug exists when a unit is attacking another unit but not moving, the moving trail still is emitting and if the unit dies, the allied unit stops by the trail keeps emitting\r\n",
