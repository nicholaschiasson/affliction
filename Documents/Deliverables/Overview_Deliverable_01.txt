Project Prototype

Submit a working software prototype for your game, following the architecture described in your project proposal, and implemented in Unity.

The prototype should include the following technical requirements:

- 3D rendering based on an isometric view, using appropriate illumination, and incorporating shadows.

- 3D models for the terrain and units, with appropriate textures and material definitions assigned to them.

- Collision detection between objects, and between objects and terrain.

- A few instances of each type of unit already created when the game starts.

- Implementation of the actions and interactions between units, including the game mechanics corresponding to them (meaning their effect on the world state). For example, the user should be able to select an action and click on a unit and target to perform the action. It is fine if the models are static and the units move around rigidly. Animation is a requirement of the next prototype.

- Camera movement: it is fine to have a fixed angle of view as in most RTS games, but the user should be able to scroll around the terrain to reach areas out of sight, which implies a controlled movement of the camera. As a bonus, you can add automatic camera tracking, e.g., based on unit in focus.

- Enemy AI, pathfinding and full game mechanics are not needed yet. These will be requirements of the last prototype.

For your submission, include the source code (scenes, scripts, etc.) for your game and a readme.txt detailing the basic instructions for playing the game. Also submit an updated proposal if your architecture has been modified. Highlight the modified parts of the report. Submit one zip file per group.
